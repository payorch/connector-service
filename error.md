# Connector Integration Build and Test Status

## Fiserv Authorize Flow Integration & Test Setup

The `connector-integration` package build was **successful** after implementing the Authorize flow for the Fiserv connector, making related fixes, and setting up the structure for Fiserv unit tests.

**Key outcomes:**
- `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/fiserv.rs` created and implemented with Authorize flow logic and `#[cfg(test)] pub mod test;`.
- `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/fiserv/transformers.rs` created and implemented with necessary request/response structs and transformations.
- Necessary changes made to `backend/domain_types/src/connector_types.rs`, `backend/domain_types/src/types.rs` (Connectors struct made public, `connector_meta_data` handling for gRPC `bytes` to internal `Secret<JsonValue::String>`), `backend/connector-integration/src/types.rs`, `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors.rs`, and `config/development.toml`.
- Test file `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/elavon/test.rs` was updated to include `fiserv` in the `Connectors` struct and use the correct `PaymentsResponseData` type.
- Test file `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/test.rs` was updated to include `fiserv` in the `Connectors` struct.
- HMAC signature logic in `fiserv.rs` was uncommented and dependencies (`ring`, `base64`) confirmed.
- Compiler warnings related to unused imports and dead code in test files (`adyen/test.rs`, `elavon/test.rs`, `fiserv/test.rs`) were resolved.
- A `grpcurl` integration test guide for Fiserv authorize flow was created: `memory-bank/fiserv_authorize_grpcurl_guide.md`.

**`grpcurl` Test for Fiserv Authorize:**
- **SUCCESSFUL**: After several iterations of debugging `connector_meta_data` handling and ensuring the correct `base_url` in `config/development.toml`, the `grpcurl` command for `PaymentService/PaymentAuthorize` with Fiserv was successful using the card number `4147463011110083`.
  - Request ID: `GRPCURL_FISERV_AUTH_009`
  - Response: `CHARGED`
  - Connector Transaction ID: `49402f5007cd43b6ad761f315f70898a`
  - Connector Response Reference ID: `CHG014b7cd1406a858799762f1a651e4247e4`
- Initial attempts with other test cards failed with "Unable to assign card to brand: Invalid", highlighting the need for specific, approved test card details for the Fiserv test environment.

**Skipped/Problematic Files (from previous task summary, may need re-evaluation):**
- `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/fiserv/test.rs`: While warnings were fixed, the unit tests themselves still need to be addressed. One test (`test_authorize_request_build`) was failing due to an incorrect assertion about a `device.browserDetails.ip` field.
- `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/razorpay/test.rs`: This file was previously skipped for updates.
- `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet/test.rs`: This file was previously noted as needing updates.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Address unit test failures in `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/fiserv/test.rs`.
2.  Address unit test failures in `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/elavon/test.rs`.
3.  Review and update `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/razorpay/test.rs` and `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet/test.rs` (and any other similar test files) to include the `fiserv` connector if necessary and ensure they compile and pass.
4.  Run `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` to automatically fix any remaining minor lint issues.
5.  Run all tests using `cargo test --all-features`.
