# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial project setup and documentation
- Memory Bank initialization
- Core architecture implementation

## Recent Changes
1. Created Memory Bank structure
2. Initialized core documentation files
3. Documented system architecture and patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate Memory Bank documentation
2. Identify any missing documentation
3. Plan implementation of core components
4. Set up development environment

## Active Decisions
1. Using Rust as primary implementation language
2. gRPC for service communication
3. Trait-based connector implementation
4. Stateless architecture design

## Important Patterns
1. Connector Integration Pattern
   - Standardized trait implementation
   - Consistent error handling
   - Reusable components

2. Webhook Processing Pattern
   - Event type identification
   - Source verification
   - Normalized event handling

## Project Insights
1. **Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular design
   - Extensible structure

2. **Development**
   - Strong typing through Protocol Buffers
   - Consistent error handling
   - Comprehensive testing approach

3. **Integration**
   - Standardized connector interface
   - Easy processor addition
   - Consistent API across languages

## Current Considerations
1. **Performance**
   - Response time optimization
   - Resource utilization
   - Scalability planning

2. **Security**
   - API authentication
   - Data encryption
   - Webhook verification

3. **Maintainability**
   - Code organization
   - Documentation standards
   - Testing coverage
