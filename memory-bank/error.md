# AuthorizedotNet Connector Error Log

**Last Build Status (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC):** Successful

All compilation errors and warnings related to the AuthorizedotNet connector (Authorize flow) have been resolved.

**Previously Encountered Major Errors (Now Resolved):
**
1.  **Orphan Rule Violation (E0117):**
    *   **File:** `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet/transformers.rs`
    *   **Issue:** `impl ForeignTryFrom<(AuthorizedotnetPaymentsResponse, RouterDataV2<...>, ...)> for RouterDataV2<...>`.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored to a standalone public function `convert_to_payments_response_data_or_error` in `transformers.rs` and updated call site in `authorizedotnet.rs`.

2.  **Type Mismatch / `?` Operator Conversion (E0277):**
    *   **File:** `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet/transformers.rs`
    *   **Issue:** In `TryFrom` for `AuthorizedotnetPaymentsRequest`, using `change_context().attach_printable_lazy().?` when `Self::Error` was an error enum (`errors::ConnectorError`), but `change_context` produced a `Report<errors::ConnectorError>`.
    *   **Resolution:** Changed error mapping to `map_err(|_| errors::ConnectorError::Variant)?` to directly return the enum variant.

3.  **Unreachable Pattern Warning:**
    *   **File:** `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet/transformers.rs`
    *   **Issue:** In `get_hs_status` function, the `match` on `AuthorizedotnetPaymentStatus` had a redundant `_` arm.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the `_` arm as all enum variants were covered.

4.  **Tooling Issues (`read_file` and `edit_file` apply model):**
    *   **File:** `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/authorizedotnet.rs`
    *   **Issue:** The `read_file` tool frequently returned corrupted or incomplete content for this file, leading to misdiagnosis of issues and failed edit attempts by the `edit_file` apply model.
    *   **Resolution:** Required multiple retries, more explicit edit instructions, and careful verification of applied changes.

All other minor linter errors and warnings (unused imports, dead code) were resolved via `cargo fix` or manual edits.
