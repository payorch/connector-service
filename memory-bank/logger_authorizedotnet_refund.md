## Authorizedotnet Connector: Refund Flow Implementation Log

This document summarizes the key steps and challenges encountered during the implementation of the Refund flow for the `authorizedotnet` connector.

**1. Modifications in `authorizedotnet/transformers.rs`:**

*   **Enums Updated:**
    *   `Operation` enum: Added `Refund`. Addressed initial redefinition issues (manual user fix was required for duplicated `Operation` enum definitions from prior edits).
    *   `TransactionType` enum: Added `RefundTransaction`.
*   **Refund Request Structures Defined:**
    *   `AuthorizedotnetRefundCardDetails` (struct for card number, expiration date).
    *   `AuthorizedotnetRefundPaymentDetails` (enum, initially struct, changed to enum `CreditCard(CreditCardDetails)`).
    *   `AuthorizedotnetRefundTransactionDetails` (struct containing `transaction_type`, `amount`, `currency_code`, `reference_transaction_id`, `payment: Option<AuthorizedotnetRefundPaymentDetails>`, `order: Option<Order>`). The `payment` field was made optional.
    *   `CreateTransactionRefundRequest` (struct wrapping `MerchantAuthentication` and `AuthorizedotnetRefundTransactionDetails`).
    *   `AuthorizedotnetRefundRequest` (top-level struct wrapping `CreateTransactionRefundRequest`).
*   **Supporting Structs Updated:**
    *   `CreditCardDetails`: Added `Deserialize`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq` derives.
    *   `Order`: Added `Deserialize`, `Clone` derives.
*   **`TryFrom` for `AuthorizedotnetRefundRequest` Implemented:**
    *   Takes `(&'a RouterDataV2<Refund, RefundFlowData, RefundsData, RefundsResponseData>, MerchantAuthentication)` as input.
    *   Converts `minor_refund_amount` to a major unit string using `to_major_unit_string`.
    *   Retrieves `connector_transaction_id` as `ref_trans_id`.
    *   **Key Detail:** `AuthorizedotnetRefundPaymentDetails` (card details for the refund) is set to `None` in the request. This is because `PaymentMethodData` is not directly available in `RefundFlowData` or `RefundsData` to populate it for the outgoing request to Authorize.Net. The connector currently sends refund requests without explicit card details in the `payment` field of the transaction request.
    *   Populates `order` details using `refund_id`.
*   **`convert_to_refund_response_data_or_error` Function Created:**
    *   Takes `&AuthorizedotnetPaymentsResponse` and `http_status_code`.
    *   Determines `api_call_attempt_status` (an `AttemptStatus`) based on `response.messages.result_code` and `response.transaction_response.response_code` (if present).
    *   Maps `api_call_attempt_status` to `hyperswitch_common_enums::RefundStatus` (`Success`, `Failure`, `Pending`).
    *   If successful, populates `RefundsResponseData { connector_refund_id, refund_status }` using `transaction_id` from the response.
    *   Handles error mapping to `ErrorResponse`, extracting error codes and messages.
*   **`get_hs_status` Function Updated:**
    *   Addressed non-exhaustive pattern errors (E0004) for `Operation::Refund` by adding fallback arms: `Operation::Refund => hyperswitch_common_enums::enums::AttemptStatus::Failure`. This function is primarily for payment/void status, actual refund status is handled by `convert_to_refund_response_data_or_error`.

**2. Modifications in `authorizedotnet.rs`:**

*   **Implemented `ConnectorIntegrationV2<Refund, RefundFlowData, RefundsData, RefundsResponseData> for Authorizedotnet`:**
    *   `get_headers()`: Returns standard `Content-Type: application/json` header. Authentication is handled in the request body via `MerchantAuthentication`.
    *   `get_url()`: Returns the base URL for Authorize.Net (e.g., `https://apitest.authorize.net/xml/v1/request.api`).
    *   `get_request_body()`:
        *   Retrieves `MerchantAuthentication` from `connector_auth_type`.
        *   Calls `AuthorizedotnetRefundRequest::try_from((req, merchant_auth))` to build the request payload.
        *   Wraps the request in `RequestContent::Json`.
    *   `handle_response_v2()`:
        *   Parses the incoming `Response` into `authorizedotnet_transformers::AuthorizedotnetPaymentsResponse`. (Handles UTF-8 BOM removal).
        *   Calls `authorizedotnet_transformers::convert_to_refund_response_data_or_error()` to process the response.
        *   Sets `router_data_out.resource_common_data.status` to the `refund_status` from the parsed refund response.
        *   Sets `router_data_out.response` to the `Result<RefundsResponseData, ErrorResponse>`.
    *   `get_error_response_v2()` and `get_5xx_error_response()`: Utilize `self.build_error_response()`.
*   **Warnings Fixed:**
    *   Prefixed unused `req` parameter in `get_headers` with `_`.
    *   Prefixed unused `_attempt_status` variable (result from `convert_to_refund_response_data_or_error`) in `handle_response_v2` with `_`.

**3. Build and Debugging Process:**

*   The implementation involved several `cargo build` cycles.
*   An initial significant hurdle was the `Operation` enum being defined multiple times due to problematic previous edits. This was resolved by the user manually correcting the enum definition.
*   Other compilation errors in `transformers.rs` that were fixed included:
    *   Missing derives (`Deserialize`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`) for `TransactionType`.
    *   Missing derives (`Deserialize`, `Clone`) for `Order`.
    *   `AuthorizedotnetRefundPaymentDetails` needing `Clone` and being defined as an `enum` instead of a `struct`.
    *   Incorrect `StrongSecret` instantiation for `card_number` in `TryFrom` for `AuthorizedotnetRefundRequest`.
    *   Initial attempts to access `payment_method_data` from `RefundFlowData` which is not available, leading to the decision to send `payment: None` in the refund request.
    *   The `payment` field in `AuthorizedotnetRefundTransactionDetails` was made an `Option`.
    *   Non-exhaustive pattern matching for `Operation::Refund` in `get_hs_status`.
*   All build errors and subsequent warnings related to the refund flow were successfully resolved.

**Final Status:** The Refund flow implementation for `authorizedotnet` (card payments) is complete and compiles successfully.
