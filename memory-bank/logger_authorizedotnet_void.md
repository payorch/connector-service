# Authorize.Net Void Flow Implementation Log

This document logs the key steps and decisions made during the implementation of the Void flow for the Authorize.Net connector.

## Void Flow Implementation Steps:

1.  **`transformers.rs` Modifications:**
    *   Added `VoidTransaction` variant to the `TransactionType` enum.
    *   Added a `Void` variant to the `Operation` enum (used for shared response handling logic).
    *   Defined new structs specifically for the Void request flow:
        *   `AuthorizedotnetTransactionVoidDetails`: Contains `transaction_type` (set to `VoidTransaction`) and `ref_trans_id`.
        *   `CreateTransactionVoidRequest`: Wraps `MerchantAuthentication` and `AuthorizedotnetTransactionVoidDetails`.
        *   `AuthorizedotnetVoidRequest`: The top-level request struct containing `CreateTransactionVoidRequest`.
    *   Implemented `TryFrom<(&'a RouterDataV2<domain_types::connector_flow::Void, ...>, MerchantAuthentication)> for AuthorizedotnetVoidRequest`:
        *   This transformation takes the generic `RouterDataV2` for Void and `MerchantAuthentication`.
        *   It constructs the `AuthorizedotnetVoidRequest` using `TransactionType::VoidTransaction` and the `connector_transaction_id` from the input router data as `ref_trans_id`.
        *   This implementation does *not* use the `AuthorizedotnetRouterData` wrapper, as amount is not part of a Void request.
    *   Updated the `get_hs_status` helper function:
        *   For `Operation::Void`, if `response.messages.result_code` is `Ok`, it returns `AttemptStatus::Voided`, even if `transaction_response` is `None` (which is expected for some successful void operations with Authorize.Net).
    *   Updated the `convert_to_payments_response_data_or_error` helper function:
        *   When `operation` is `Void` and the derived `status` is `AttemptStatus::Voided`:
            *   If `transaction_response` is present and indicates success, it populates `PaymentsResponseData` as usual.
            *   If `transaction_response` is `None` (but `messages.result_code` was `Ok`), it successfully populates `PaymentsResponseData::TransactionResponse` with `resource_id: ResponseId::NoResponseId` and other fields set to `None` or defaults, signifying a successful void without a detailed transaction body from the connector.

2.  **`authorizedotnet.rs` Modifications:**
    *   Implemented the `ConnectorIntegrationV2<Void, PaymentFlowData, PaymentVoidData, PaymentsResponseData>` trait for the `Authorizedotnet` struct.
    *   `get_headers`: Reused common header logic (content type and auth headers).
    *   `get_url`: Reused the common base URL for `createTransactionRequest`.
    *   `get_request_body`:
        *   Constructs `MerchantAuthentication` from `req.connector_auth_type`.
        *   Calls `AuthorizedotnetVoidRequest::try_from((req, merchant_auth))` to create the connector-specific void request payload.
        *   Wraps the serialized request in `RequestContent::Json`.
    *   `handle_response_v2`:
        *   Deserializes the JSON response from Authorize.Net into `AuthorizedotnetPaymentsResponse`.
        *   Calls the shared `convert_to_payments_response_data_or_error` function, passing `Operation::Void`, to get the `AttemptStatus` and `PaymentsResponseData` (or `ErrorResponse`).
        *   Updates the `RouterDataV2` with the outcome.

3.  **Build and Linter Checks:**
    *   The implementation was followed by `cargo build` commands, and any resulting compiler or linter errors were addressed iteratively throughout the development of Authorize, Capture, and Void flows.
    *   The final build after implementing Void and fixing test file issues was successful.
