1. **Start**: Begin the connector integration process for Elavon (Cards Authorize Flow). Ref: build_workflow.md, Hyperswitch elavon.rs, elavon/transformers.rs. 

[NEW_FEEDBACK_DATE_PLACEHOLDER] FEEDBACK:
The Elavon connector implementation had several discrepancies compared to the Hyperswitch reference and general best practices:

- **Header Imports**: `headers` were being imported from `hyperswitch_interfaces` instead of being defined locally within `elavon.rs` or imported from a shared module like `common_utils::consts`.
- **RequestContent Import**: `RequestContent` was not correctly imported from `hyperswitch_common_utils::request`.
- **`ElavonAuthType` Visibility**: The fields within `ElavonAuthType` in `transformers.rs` were not marked with `pub(super)` as is conventional in the Hyperswitch reference.
- **`ElavonRouterData` Structure**: The `ElavonRouterData` struct in `transformers.rs` contained extra fields (e.g., `auth`, `payment_method_data`) beyond `amount` and `router_data` which is the pattern in other connectors like Razorpay.
- **`ElavonPaymentsRequest` Structure**:
    - The `ElavonPaymentsRequest` enum in `transformers.rs` was defined as a single struct instead of an enum with `Card(CardPaymentRequest)` and potentially `MandatePayment(MandatePaymentRequest)` variants as seen in the Hyperswitch reference.
    - The `CardPaymentRequest` struct (if it were part of the enum) was missing some fields present in the Hyperswitch reference (like `ssl_transaction_currency`) and included auth-related fields (`ssl_merchant_id`, `ssl_user_id`, `ssl_pin`) which should be part of `ElavonAuthType` and handled separately, not directly in the payment request body struct. It also included other fields not strictly part of the Hyperswitch `CardPaymentRequest` like `ssl_invoice_number`, `ssl_test_mode`, `ssl_add_token`, `ssl_token_source`. The structure should mirror the Hyperswitch `CardPaymentRequest` for the authorize flow.
- **`ElavonPaymentsResponse` Structure**: The `ElavonPaymentsResponse` struct in `transformers.rs` did not match the Hyperswitch reference, which uses a nested structure like `ElavonPaymentsResponse { result: ElavonResult }` where `ElavonResult` is an enum `Success(PaymentResponse) | Error(ElavonErrorResponse)`. The existing implementation was a flat struct.
- **`payment_method_token` Handling**: The attempt to set `router_data_target.payment_method_token` in `transformers.rs` is problematic because `RouterDataV2` in this project does not seem to have this field directly. The token, if received from Elavon, needs to be stored in the appropriate field within `PaymentsResponseData::TransactionResponse` or handled according to how the project expects payment tokens to be managed. The type mismatch for `PaymentMethodToken::Token` (expecting `Secret<String>` but got `String`) also needs to be addressed.
- **AVS Field Access**: The `get_avs_details_from_payment_address` function in `transformers.rs` was trying to access `line1` and `zip` directly on `PaymentAddress`, which might be incorrect if these are nested or private. The correct access path for billing address fields (e.g., via `address.get_billing().and_then(|b| b.address.as_ref()).map_or(...)`) needs to be ensured.
- **`ssl_customer_code` Type**: In `ElavonPaymentsRequest` (within `transformers.rs`), `ssl_customer_code` was `Option<String>` but the data from `req.request.customer_id.map(|c| c.get_string_repr())` might be `Option<&str>` or require a clone/conversion.
- **`redirection_data` and `mandate_reference` Boxing**: In the `TryFrom` for `RouterDataV2` in `transformers.rs`, `redirection_data: None` and `mandate_reference: None` were assigned directly, but these fields in `PaymentsResponseData::TransactionResponse` expect `Box<Option<...>>`. They should be `Box::new(None)`.

**Fixes Applied / Attempted:**
- Modified `elavon.rs` to define a local `headers` module.
- Corrected `RequestContent` import in `elavon.rs`.
- Updated `ElavonAuthType` field visibility in `elavon/transformers.rs`.
- Simplified `ElavonRouterData` in `elavon/transformers.rs`.
- Restructured `ElavonPaymentsRequest` to be an enum with a `CardPaymentRequest` variant and corrected its fields to align with the Hyperswitch reference for the authorize flow in `elavon/transformers.rs`. Auth fields are now taken from `ElavonAuthType` where appropriate.
- Restructured `ElavonPaymentsResponse` and added `ElavonResult`, `PaymentResponseDataStruct`, and `ErrorResponseDataStruct` to match the Hyperswitch reference structure in `elavon/transformers.rs`.
- Addressed linter errors in `elavon/transformers.rs` related to AVS details, `ssl_customer_code`, and boxing of `redirection_data` and `mandate_reference`.
- The `payment_method_token` issue in `elavon/transformers.rs` is still complex due to the `RouterDataV2` structure; for now, ensuring type compatibility for the token itself (`Secret<String>`) if/when it's assigned.


[PREVIOUS_LOGS_PLACEHOLDER] 

**Recent Activity (Pre-Correction & Analysis):**

1.  **Initial `elavon.rs` Creation & Iterative Fixes:**
    *   An initial version of `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/elavon.rs` was created with a basic structure for the Authorize flow.
    *   **Attempt 1:** Contained syntax errors (entire file wrapped in triple quotes) and incorrect header constant usage.
    *   **Attempt 2:** Fixed the triple-quote issue, aimed to correct imports and header constant. Still had trailing triple quotes.
    *   **Attempt 3:** Aimed to remove trailing quotes, fix error reporting in boilerplate (e.g., `report!` macro), ensure correct response parsing (`Vec<u8>` to `String`), and adjust trait method names (e.g., `handle_response` to `handle_response_v2`). This attempt still resulted in linter errors, including a leftover `</rewritten_file>` marker, issues with trait method names not matching `ConnectorIntegrationV2` (e.g., `handle_response` vs `handle_response_v2`), and problems with `ResponseRouterData` usage.

2.  **Placeholder `transformers.rs` Creation:**
    *   Created a placeholder file `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/elavon/transformers.rs` with minimal content, likely to satisfy module dependencies.

3.  **Re-read `elavon.rs` for Assessment:**
    *   The `elavon.rs` file was read to assess its current state after the previous edit attempts. The content confirmed the presence of the `</rewritten_file>` marker and other unresolved issues.

4.  **Linter Errors Encountered During Setup:**
    *   A linter error occurred in `backend/connector-integration/src/types.rs` (non-exhaustive patterns for `ConnectorEnum::Elavon` in `convert_connector`) which was presumed to be resolvable by later changes.
    *   A linter error correctly identified that `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/elavon.rs` was missing when `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors.rs` was updated to declare the `elavon` module.

**Current Goal:** Resolve compilation issues in `elavon.rs` and implement the Authorize flow, referencing Hyperswitch. Other flows are to be stubbed. 


**Elavon Capture Flow Implementation (Ongoing):**

1.  **Capture Implementation Guide Creation:**
    *   Created `memory-bank/capture_implementation_guide.md` to document the steps for implementing the capture flow, referencing Elavon and Razorpay examples.

2.  **Modifications to `elavon/transformers.rs` for Capture:**
    *   Added `CcComplete` to the `TransactionType` enum for capture operations.
    *   Defined the `ElavonCaptureRequest` struct to model the request payload for Elavon's capture API.
    *   Implemented `TryFrom<&ElavonRouterData<&RouterDataV2<Capture, ...>>> for ElavonCaptureRequest` to convert the application's generic capture request into the Elavon-specific format. This included extracting `connector_transaction_id` (as `ssl_txn_id`) and other necessary fields.
    *   Implemented `ForeignTryFrom<(ElavonResult, RouterDataV2<Capture, ...>, u16)> for RouterDataV2<Capture, ...>` to convert Elavon's capture response back into the application's generic router data. This involved:
        *   Mapping Elavon's response fields to `PaymentsResponseData`.
        *   Updating `PaymentFlowData`'s `status` field based on the capture outcome.
        *   This step encountered a persistent "no such field" linter error when attempting to spread `..router_data_in.resource_common_data` while updating the `status` in `PaymentFlowData`. Various attempts to resolve this by explicitly listing fields or cloning and mutating were unsuccessful due to related linter issues.
    *   Updated the `get_elavon_attempt_status` helper function to handle HTTP codes and determine the attempt status specifically for capture responses (looking for `cccomplete` in `ssl_transaction_type`).

3.  **Modifications to `elavon.rs` for Capture:**
    *   Implemented the `ConnectorIntegrationV2<Capture, PaymentFlowData, PaymentsCaptureData, PaymentsResponseData>` trait for the `Elavon` struct.
    *   `get_headers`: Configured to use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for capture requests.
    *   `get_url`: Set to Elavon's `processxml.do` endpoint.
    *   `get_request_body`: Implemented to:
        *   Use the `amount_converter` to correctly format the capture amount.
        *   Utilize the local `struct_to_xml` function (similar to the Authorize flow) to serialize the `ElavonCaptureRequest` into an XML string for the request body.
    *   `handle_response_v2`: Adapted to:
        *   Deserialize the XML response from Elavon.
        *   Call the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation in `elavon/transformers.rs` to process the capture response.
    *   Addressed linter errors related to amount conversion and request body construction.

4.  **Persistent Issue:**
    *   The primary blocking issue remains the "no such field" linter error in `elavon/transformers.rs` within the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation for the capture flow, specifically when trying to update the `status` field of `PaymentFlowData` using struct update syntax with a spread operator for `router_data_in.resource_common_data`.

**Elavon Refund Flow Implementation (Completed):**

1.  **Modifications to `elavon/transformers.rs` for Refund:**
    *   Added `ElavonRefundRequest` struct containing fields like `ssl_transaction_type` (set to `CcReturn`), auth details (`ssl_account_id`, `ssl_user_id`, `ssl_pin`), `ssl_amount`, `ssl_txn_id` (original connector transaction ID), `ssl_transaction_currency`, and an optional `ssl_invoice_number`.
    *   Implemented `TryFrom<&ElavonRouterData<&RouterDataV2<Refund, ...>>> for ElavonRefundRequest`:
        *   Extracts authentication details and the original `connector_transaction_id`.
        *   Sets `ssl_transaction_type` to `TransactionType::CcReturn`.
        *   Populates other fields from the `RouterDataV2` request and `ElavonRouterData`.
    *   Implemented `ForeignTryFrom<(ElavonResult, RouterDataV2<Refund, ...>, u16)> for RouterDataV2<Refund, ...>`:
        *   Takes the `ElavonResult` (parsed from the connector's XML response), the incoming `RouterDataV2`, and the HTTP status code.
        *   Uses the `get_elavon_attempt_status` helper to determine an overall attempt status (primarily for error scenarios).
        *   If `ElavonResult` is `Success`:
            *   Determines `hyperswitch_common_enums::RefundStatus` based on `success_payload.ssl_transaction_type` (expecting "ccreturn") and `success_payload.ssl_result` (`Approved` maps to `Success`, `Declined` to `Failure`, `Other` to `Pending`).
            *   Populates `RefundsResponseData` with `connector_refund_id` (from `ssl_txn_id`) and the determined `refund_status`.
            *   Updates the `status` field in `router_data_in.resource_common_data` (which is of type `RefundFlowData`) with the new `refund_status`.
        *   If `ElavonResult` is `Error`:
            *   Constructs an `ErrorResponse` using details from `error_payload_struct` and `error_response_opt`.
            *   Sets the `status` in `router_data_in.resource_common_data` to `hyperswitch_common_enums::RefundStatus::Failure`.
    *   Manually resolved linter errors related to `connector_transaction_id` type mismatch, `payment_id` field access in `RefundFlowData`, and incorrect argument count for `get_elavon_attempt_status` by the user.

2.  **Modifications to `elavon.rs` for Refund:**
    *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegrationV2<Refund, RefundFlowData, RefundsData, RefundsResponseData>` for the `Elavon` struct.
    *   `get_headers`: Configured to use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
    *   `get_url`: Set to Elavon's `processxml.do` endpoint.
    *   `get_request_body`: 
        *   Uses `self.amount_converter.convert` to format `req.request.minor_refund_amount`.
        *   Wraps the request with `ElavonRouterData`.
        *   Calls `ElavonRefundRequest::try_from` to get the connector-specific request.
        *   Serializes the `ElavonRefundRequest` to XML using `struct_to_xml` for the form-urlencoded body.
    *   `handle_response_v2`:
        *   Converts the raw response (byte vector) to a UTF-8 string.
        *   Deserializes the string (which is URL-encoded XML) into `ElavonPaymentsResponse` using `serde_qs::from_str`.
        *   Calls the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation in `elavon/transformers.rs` (passing `elavon_response.result`, the original router data, and HTTP status code) to process the refund response.
    *   Corrected linter errors related to `convert_amount` usage (changed to `self.amount_converter.convert`) and `error_stack` usage within `map_err` for response deserialization by the user.
    *   A persistent linter error related to `with_response_body!` macro call in `elavon.rs` (Refund flow `handle_response_v2`) was noted and subsequently fixed by the user.

3.  **Error File Update (`error.md`):**
    *   The `memory-bank/error.md` file will be cleared as the user has manually resolved all linter errors for the refund flow.

**Elavon PSync (Payment Sync) Flow Implementation (Completed):**

1.  **Modifications to `elavon/transformers.rs` for PSync:**
    *   Defined `ElavonPsyncRequest` struct with `ssl_transaction_type` (set to `TxnQuery`), Elavon authentication fields (`ssl_account_id`, `ssl_user_id`, `ssl_pin`), and `ssl_txn_id` (the connector transaction ID of the payment to be queried).
    *   Implemented `TryFrom<&RouterDataV2<PSync, ...>> for ElavonPsyncRequest` to transform the generic PSync `RouterDataV2` into an `ElavonPsyncRequest`.
    *   Initially, `ElavonPsyncResponse` was defined with fields like `ssl_result`, `error_code`, `error_message`, etc. This was later corrected by the user to a more specific structure for PSync: `ElavonPSyncResponse { ssl_trans_status: TransactionSyncStatus, ssl_transaction_type: SyncTransactionType, ssl_txn_id: String }`.
    *   Defined `TransactionSyncStatus` enum (e.g., `PEN`, `OPN`, `STL`, `FPR`) and `SyncTransactionType` enum (e.g., `Sale`, `AuthOnly`, `Return`) to represent Elavon's specific PSync response values.
    *   Implemented `ForeignTryFrom<(ElavonPSyncResponse, RouterDataV2<PSync, ...>, ...)> for RouterDataV2<PSync, ...>`:
        *   Takes the corrected `ElavonPSyncResponse`.
        *   Maps `psync_response.ssl_trans_status` and `psync_response.ssl_transaction_type` to the appropriate `HyperswitchAttemptStatus` (e.g., `STL` + `Sale` maps to `Charged`; `OPN` + `AuthOnly` maps to `Authorized`; `FPR` maps to `Failure`).
        *   Populates `PaymentsResponseData` with `connector_transaction_id` from `psync_response.ssl_txn_id` and sets `network_txn_id` and `connector_response_reference_id` to `None` (as `ssl_approval_code` is not in the corrected `ElavonPSyncResponse`).

2.  **Modifications to `elavon.rs` for PSync:**
    *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegrationV2<PSync, PaymentFlowData, PaymentsSyncData, PaymentsResponseData>` for the `Elavon` struct.
    *   `get_http_method`: Set to `POST` as Elavon's `TxnQuery` is a POST request.
    *   `get_url`: Set to use the standard `processxml.do` endpoint.
    *   `get_request_body`: Creates an `ElavonPsyncRequest` (after correcting a `TryFrom` signature mismatch where `&&RouterDataV2` was passed instead of `&RouterDataV2`) and serializes it to XML using `struct_to_xml` for the form-urlencoded body.
    *   `handle_response_v2`:
        *   Initially, it was attempting to parse the response as `RazorpayPaymentResponse` due to a copy-paste error, then corrected to `elavon::ElavonPaymentsResponse` (the general one), and finally corrected to parse directly into `elavon::ElavonPSyncResponse` using `deserialize_xml_to_struct` (as the response for `TxnQuery` is also XML, but should be deserialized into the specific `ElavonPSyncResponse` struct, not `ElavonPaymentsResponse` which has the `result` field).
        *   Calls the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation in `elavon/transformers.rs` to process the PSync response.

3.  **Linter Error Resolution:**
    *   Resolved `E0277` "trait bound not satisfied" for `ElavonPsyncRequest::try_from` in `elavon.rs` by changing the call from `try_from(&req)` to `try_from(req)`.
    *   Addressed linter errors in `elavon/transformers.rs` after the user updated `ElavonPSyncResponse` by ensuring the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation used the correct new fields (`ssl_trans_status`, `ssl_transaction_type`).
    *   Removed various unused imports from both `elavon.rs` and `elavon/transformers.rs`.

4.  **Error File Update (`error.md`):**
    *   The `memory-bank/error.md` file will be cleared as all PSync flow related errors are now resolved.

**Recent Activity (Pre-Correction & Analysis):**

**Elavon RSync (Refund Sync) Flow Implementation (Completed):**

1.  **Modifications to `elavon/transformers.rs` for RSync:**
    *   Added `RefundStatus as HyperswitchRefundStatus` to imports.
    *   Defined `ElavonRSyncRequest` struct with `ssl_transaction_type` (set to `TxnQuery`), Elavon authentication fields, and `ssl_txn_id` (the `connector_refund_id` to query).
    *   Implemented `TryFrom<&RouterDataV2<RSync, ...>> for ElavonRSyncRequest`:
        *   Correctly accessed `connector_refund_id` from `router_data.request.connector_refund_id.clone()` (previously had a `get_connector_refund_id()` call which was incorrect for `RefundSyncData`).
    *   Defined `ElavonRSyncResponse` struct (similar to `ElavonPSyncResponse`) with `ssl_trans_status`, `ssl_transaction_type`, and `ssl_txn_id`. Added `#[derive(Serialize)]` for logging compatibility.
    *   Created `get_refund_status_from_elavon_sync_response` helper function to map Elavon's RSync response fields to `HyperswitchRefundStatus`.
    *   Implemented `ForeignTryFrom<(ElavonRSyncResponse, RouterDataV2<RSync, ...>, u16)> for RouterDataV2<RSync, ...>`:
        *   Clones the input `router_data_in`.
        *   Sets `router_data_out.response` with `RefundsResponseData` containing the mapped `refund_status` and `connector_refund_id`.
        *   Sets `router_data_out.resource_common_data.status` to the mapped `refund_status`.

2.  **Modifications to `elavon.rs` for RSync:**
    *   Implemented `ConnectorIntegrationV2<RSync, RefundFlowData, RefundSyncData, RefundsResponseData>` for the `Elavon` struct.
    *   `get_http_method`: Set to `POST`.
    *   `get_headers`: Standard headers for form-urlencoded content.
    *   `get_url`: Corrected to directly use `req.resource_common_data.connectors.elavon.base_url` to resolve mismatched `Connectors` type error (was previously trying to use `self.base_url(&req.connector_meta_data)` or `self.base_url(&req.resource_common_data.connectors)` which expected a different `Connectors` type from `hyperswitch_interfaces`).
    *   `get_request_body`: Creates an `ElavonRSyncRequest` and serializes it to XML using `struct_to_xml`, then wraps with `RequestContent::FormUrlEncoded(Box::new(form_payload))` (corrected to include `Box::new()`).
    *   `handle_response_v2`: Deserializes the XML response into `ElavonRSyncResponse` and then calls the `ForeignTryFrom` implementation.
    *   `get_error_response_v2`: Reuses `self.build_error_response`.

3.  **Linter and Build Error Resolution:**
    *   Fixed method `get_connector_refund_id` not found on `RefundSyncData` by directly accessing the field `connector_refund_id`.
    *   Resolved mismatched types in `RouterDataV2::from` and `set_resource_common_data` by directly mutating a clone of the input `RouterDataV2`.
    *   Fixed mismatched `Connectors` type in `elavon.rs` for `get_url` by directly accessing `req.resource_common_data.connectors.elavon.base_url`.
    *   Added `Serialize` derive to `ElavonRSyncResponse` in `transformers.rs` to fix trait bound issues with the `with_response_body!` macro.
    *   Corrected `RequestContent::FormUrlEncoded` usage in `elavon.rs` by wrapping the payload with `Box::new()`.

4.  **Build Status:**
    *   `cargo build` completed successfully after all fixes.

5.  **Error File Update (`error.md`):**
    *   The `memory-bank/error.md` file has been cleared.

**(Previous flow logs for Authorize, Capture, Refund, PSync remain above this RSync section.)**
