1. **Start**: Begin the connector integration process for Jpmorgan (Authorize Flow). 
2. **Add connector support**: Modifying necessary files to add Jpmorgan connector support and creating connector files. 
3. **Take a reference from Hyperswitch**: Referencing Hyperswitch Jpmorgan connector for request/response structs and transformers.
4. **Validation Step**: Implementing transformation logic from PaymentsAuthorizeData to Jpmorgan's request format. 
5. **Build using command `cargo build`**: Build the project to check for compilation errors. 
6. **Build Step (after transformer fixes)**: Attempting to build again. 
7. **Feedback on initial steps**: Missed some fundamental steps in adding connector support (e.g., ensuring correct `NEW_CONNECTOR_ID` usage, initial trait implementations, and import paths as per the guide) and made incorrect assumptions about some Hyperswitch types, leading to numerous avoidable build errors early on. Adherence to `connector_implementation_guide.md` and Hyperswitch references for `jpmorgan` should have been stricter. 
8. **Feedback on struct definitions**: The `JpmorganPaymentsRequest` and `JpmorganPaymentsResponse` structs are missing required fields and sub-structs that are present in the Hyperswitch reference. All structs, sub-structs, and enums should be defined exactly as they appear in the Hyperswitch reference to ensure complete compatibility and functionality.
